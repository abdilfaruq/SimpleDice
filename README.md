# Simple Dice
**SimpleDice** is the webapp game  built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  

When we refresh our web site then our dice get thrown randomly, so that player 1 and player 2 both have their own dice values, and our web site will announce a winner depending on whose dice value was higher.
